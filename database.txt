    "description" : "Big Bog State Recreation Area has been called Minnesota's last true wilderness. This two-part recreation area includes a northern unit and a southern unit. The 500-square-mile peat bog, the largest in the lower 48 states, is located in the northern unit. A mile-long boardwalk, completed in 2005, enables visitors to get a first-hand look at the unique plant and animal life of this rare resource. The bog, which has long been a source of medicinal plants for the Ojibwe Indians, represented a barrier to European settlers who tried in vain to drain it. Today, many of the native plants, including yellow-eyed grass, bog rush and two kinds of sundews, are on Minnesota's endangered or threatened species list. From orchids to carnivorous plants to rare birds, visitors will see a mixture of fascinating and rare resources. The southern unit includes a campground with 31 campsites (26 electric sites) winterized camper cabins, a sandy beach, picnic grounds, and great fishing.",

    "description" : "Remote and virtually undeveloped, Garden Island State Recreation Area is the northernmost unit of the Minnesota State Park system. Part of its attraction is the challenge of getting there—as you leave the south shore of Lake of the Woods, the island is 19 miles away and not yet visible on the horizon. But once you arrive, the island itself will charm you. Its quiet beaches beckon you to stroll along the retreating waves. Birds scamper at the water’s edge and dart above you in the air. Fishing boats come into dock for shore lunches, with visitors from near and far enjoying a midday break at the picnic tables. Or you may want to take a bit more time and explore the woods and marshes of the island’s interior. Winter offers opportunities too—and snowmobiling across Lake of the Woods may feel like your first Arctic adventure.",
